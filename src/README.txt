USER INSTRUCTIONS: When the program is run a pop up will appear prompting you for the number of players (1 - 4), then
                    for each players name and the game will begin. To place a tile, select it from your hand then select
                    the space on the board in which you'd like to place it. You can remove a previously placed tile (in the same turn)
                    by selecting it again from the board. For the first move it must be on the center (yellow) tile,
                    it doesn't have to begin there, as long as it passes through. When you are done placing your word,
                    click the 'Play Word' button to complete your turn. A player can skip their turn by clicking the 'Skip Turn' button.
                    The game can be restarted with the current players or a brand new game by using the 'Game' menu.
                    There is also a 'Help' button in the 'Game' menu that will display a pop up with the instructions for the game.
